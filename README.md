## Overview

This repository contains MATLAB code and datasets used in the study:

> *"Data-Driven and Machine Learning Framework for Alfalfa Yield Response to Long-Term Climate Variability in the Kansas High Plains (USA)"*

The study presents a machine learning-based modeling framework to identify key agro-climatic predictors of alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) yield across Kansas (1981–2018). Using 117 climate-derived features from PRISM and yield data from USDA-NASS, we applied Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (mRMR) feature selection, followed by forward selection using SVM, KNN, and Random Forest models with 5-fold cross-validation.

## Repository Structure

### Main Codes (Parent Directory)

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `main_yieldKSfs_mRMR_modelbased.m` | Main script: mRMR feature ranking, regression using SVM, KNN, RF, 5-fold CV. Computes RMSE for 1–117 features. |
| `main_yieldKSfs_pearsons_modelbased.m` | Same as above but with Pearson correlation-based feature ranking. |
| `mRMR_topfeatures_plotmatrix.m` | Generates a matrix-style plot of final selected mRMR features (Supplement Section 6). |
| `plot_mRMR.m` | Main file for plotting the final selected feature set. |
| `curseofdimentionality_datatofeatureratio.m` | Plots features-to-data ratio per fold to illustrate curse of dimensionality (Supplement Section 2). |
| `correlation_pearson_spearman.m` | Computes full Pearson’s and Spearman’s correlation matrices; generates plots and CSV files (Supplement Section 1). |

### Dataset Generalization and Visualization Codes (`dataset_generalization/`)

> All scripts in this folder assume the `dataset` folder is in the parent directory (`../dataset/`).

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `main_yieldKSdataset_total.m` | Combines all Kansas county USDA-NASS yield data (1981–2018) with daily PRISM weather data; generates a `county_year_yieldinfo.txt`. |
| `missingyield_countyyear.m` | Identifies missing yield reporting years per county (Supplement Section 4). |
| `prism_ppp_plot.m`, `prism_temp_plots.m`, `yieldfs_plots.m` | Generate figures of yearly yield, precipitation, and temperature across counties (Section 3.1). |

## Requirements

- **MATLAB R2023a**  
- **Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox™**  
- Internal seeding for reproducibility (`rng` with seed 0) is applied in all scripts.  
- External mRMR implementation via `fsrmrmr` function from MATLAB Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox.

## Dataset

The repository does **not** include raw data.  
> Dataset download link available upon request to corresponding authors (USDA-NASS and PRISM data).  

---

## Usage

1. Open MATLAB and set the parent directory as the working folder.  
2. Run main scripts directly, for example:  
   ```matlab
   main_yieldKSfs_mRMR_modelbased
3. After running the feature selection scripts, plotting and analysis can be performed using:

- `plot_mRMR.m` for feature visualization  
- Visualization scripts in `dataset_generalization/` for climate and yield plots  

All scripts are designed for reproducibility using internal random seeds.

---

## Outputs

The repository produces:

- RMSE results for incremental feature sets (1–117) using SVM, KNN, and RF  
- Pearson and Spearman correlation matrices, with corresponding CSV files  
- Figures for the main paper and supplemental sections as described in the scripts
